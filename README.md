# :computer: Assignment 01

## Requirements
- Write the solution to each problem statement in its corresponding Python module (`p1.py`, `p2.py` and `p3.py` respectively).
- Use functions, input parameters and return values
- Each function only does one thing!
- Do not use global variables
- Provide the user relevant messages regarding expected input and the meaning of the programâ€™s output.

## Problem Statements
### First Problem
- For a given natural number `n` find the minimal natural number `m` formed with the same digits. (e.g. `n=3658, m=3568`).

### Second Problem
- Determine a calendar date (as year, month, day) starting from two integer numbers representing the year and the day number inside that year (e.g. day number 32 is February 1st). Take into account leap years. Do not use Python's inbuilt date/time functions.

### Third Problem
- Determine the `n-th`  element of the sequence `1,2,3,2,5,2,3,7,2,3,2,5,...` obtained from the sequence of natural numbers by replacing composed numbers with their prime divisors, without memorizing the elements of the sequence.
